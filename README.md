# About

This is where I store the source files for my digital garden site. 
Check it out: [mikedownes.dev](https://mikedownes.dev)

The inspiration for this site setup comes from a couple of existing resources:

* Mike Tannebaum's Digital Garden Site, [The Refined Mind](https://refinedmind.co/)
* Maxime Vaillancourt's [Jekyll Template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) & [Tutorial](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll)

# Future Plans

I hope to use Mike & Maxime's contributions as a starter for this site. I 
already had to adapt Maxime's template to comply nicely with how I like to 
store and publish my notes. If you want to read the development log for my
experience building this site, you can do so [here](https://www.mikedownes.dev/digital-garden-dev-setup)
